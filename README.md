# StayAwake2021
Rohan's 2021 CRTC Project

THANK YOU FOR VIEWING MY PROJECT! :)

Frameworks Used:
Firebase,
OpenCV,
Dlib,
Pyglet,
Scipy,
Imutils

Languages:
Python,
Javascript,
HTML 5,
CSS

Note:
All dependencies that are not hosted (downloaded) are stored in a single virtual environment folder. 
The exception is the facial landmarks dataset which I cannot figure out how to upload to github because of the file size. I'll upload that as soon as I figure it out.
