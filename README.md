# StayAwake2021
Rohan's 2021 CRTC Project

THANK YOU FOR VIEWING MY PROJECT! :)

Frameworks Used:
Firebase,
OpenCV,
Dlib,
Pyglet,
Scipy,
Imutils

Languages:
Python,
Javascript,
HTML 5,
CSS

Note:
All dependencies that are not hosted (downloaded) are stored in a single virtual environment folder. 
The exception is the facial landmarks dataset which I cannot figure out how to upload to github because of the file size. I'll upload that as soon as I figure it out.
I'll be uploading the folder as soon as I figure out how to as github is giving me a too many files error when I upload it. As soon as I figure that out, I'll upload it so you can try my project straight out of the box. :)

If you want to try my code for yourself:
Add the virtual environment folder I made for you into your project folder (when I figure out how to upload it haha). Change your interpreter from whatever you were using in the past such as the default or something like anaconda to the virtual environment. Now, all you need to do is start flask and you're good to go! :)
